# Engine health — the planned fixes, in order

**Part 1 is what to do, in order, with no explanation.** It is what goes
to the car. **Part 2 is why, and how the results are read.** Keep it that
way (*owner's decision, 8/10/2026*). An instruction goes in Part 1 and its
reason in Part 2, never mixed. Why each step exists at all lives in
`open.md`; what was done lives in `vehicle-history.md` and `idle-log.md`.
**A step that is done is removed from both parts in the commit that
records it**, and the file is deleted when it is empty.

The full previous version, before it was condensed on 20/10/2026:

# Part 1 — what to do

## Step 3 — the idle is not fixed

One at a time; Claude says after each whether the next is needed.
Captures only where an item asks for one. **Current: item 6 and 6i
from 4/11, the MFD in; the next repair is item 8, a professional
decarbonisation.**

6. **Drive normally with the MFD in**; brisk driving once warm is
   welcome. At a warm stop that comes anyway, `IdleHealth` in the
   everyday state and the oil temperature, written into the chat.
   - **No captures for now.** Only **once `IdleHealth` on the MFD is
     clearly better**: one or two warm drives captured, on different
     days. Claude runs the capture; VCDS on **014, 003, 020**; 055 once
     at the end, warm idle. Write the stops.
6i. **The oil level on the new oil, about every 500 km** from the first
   reading (27/10, 155,024 km, at the top mark): the car on level ground
   and **at least 5 minutes standing**, the dipstick out, wiped, in, out,
   and **photographed**; the odometer into the chat. Any top-up: the litres and the odometer
   into the chat.
7. **Only if Claude asks after 6:**
   - **The exhaust test again, warm**, after a drive to 95–100 °C of oil.
     Outdoors; the tailpipe closed for a few seconds at a time, never
     longer. The phone records at the manifold; mark each closure aloud on
     the recording; listen back and report engine bay or underbody.
     Photograph the flange, the front pipe and 3 and 4's pipes from below
     for soot. **Leaks there → a new manifold**: new gasket to the head,
     new nuts, new outlet gasket, the probe refitted with anti-seize. Part
     `06A 253 031` + suffix: read the number cast into the manifold, or
     ask by VIN. New from VW about €350–490, used 700–1,500 Kč.
     Penetrating oil on the studs the days before; a snapped stud goes to
     a garage.
   - **The high-voltage side in the dark**, a damp evening, warm idle:
     bonnet open, lights off, look along the leads and the coil for a
     spark or a blue glow; then a fine water mist over one lead at a time
     and the coil, hands and bottle clear. Write anything seen and which
     lead the engine stumbled at.
8. **The next repair: a professional decarbonisation, with hydrogen**
   (*the owner's decision*, 3/11; a provider such as *Bez karbonu*,
   his choice; by its site, 3/11: 70 min for up to 2.5 l, 3,290 Kč).
   **The engine is held at 2,000 rpm throughout; nothing is measured
   before or after** (*owner*, 3/11, from their videos). The owner
   books it. **No reading of its own before it** (*the owner*, 3/11:
   the weeks before are the baseline). **After it**: item 6's drives
   again, `IdleHealth` as always.

## Standing items

- **Every drive, for the converter:**
  - Drive off within half a minute of starting; never warm it up
    standing.
  - Standing at idle: **lights, blower and rear window heater on**, the
    seat heaters too. Or a touch of throttle.
  - At a stop longer than a minute or two, where safe: engine off.
  - After a hard or long drive: switch off on arrival, no idling.
  - **Engine lamp flashing**: ease off at once, stop where safe, engine
    off, write it into the chat.
- **`IdleHealth` only in the everyday state** — **blower on 1, one seat
  heater on 1, the lights on** — at warm stops that come anyway (oil
  95–100 °C, neutral, no throttle), with the oil temperature; any other
  state is named. **Idling is kept short**: no stop is made or lengthened
  to read it.
- **The fault memory after every session with VCDS connected**: read,
  saved, then cleared by the owner by hand. Not after a plain drive.

# Part 2 — why, and how it is read

## The rule — the owner's decision, 27/9/2026, amended 18/10/2026

**The idle comes first**: the unsettled idle (S1) and the misfires 014
counts at idle (S3). **S18, cylinder 3 dropping out with a tick, came
first beside it** from 18/10 until it closed on 24/10, after a week
without it (`refuted.md` D10); the owner kept its drive rules as a
habit until the map went back (3/11), so that a return was caught (they
left Part 1 on 26/10 at his request: not a step, what he does anyway);
whether he keeps them since is his. So:

- **Fix, then look.** Each step is a repair; the only readings taken are
  the ones that decide the next step.
- **No test for its own sake**, and nothing unrelated to the idle is
  pursued until it is solved — unless it could be related.
- **Run the engine as little as possible, above all not at idle.** The
  misfires are an idle phenomenon and the old converter already paid for
  them once. Warm the engine by driving.

`open.md`'s tests are reference, **not a to-do list**.
**The cylinder 4 knock window stays out of this plan** (*owner's
decision, 9/10/2026*): G66 and the rest of H5's tests stay in `open.md`.
Where the work stands is in `idle-log.md` and `open.md`, *Where it
stands*.

## Step 3 — why, and how it is read

**Idle solved → stop and record** (`open.md` S1, *When S1 closes*; S3,
*When S3 closes*). Otherwise each item decides whether the next is
needed.

**Which VCDS groups** (*decided 11/10/2026*). **014** wherever a stop is
read for misfires. **001** wherever there is idle: engine speed to align
on and the lambda correction (`open.md` S1, *What VCDS saw just before a
dip*). **003** on every step with an idle: the idle air and advance, and
the MAF's own figure, since 12/10's least charge on record after the
airbox was sealed is what a MAF that used to over-read would explain
(`refuted.md` D4). **020** only where there is driving under load, for
cylinder 4's retard (S4). **026** reads its floor at idle and belongs to
the knock window, so it is dropped. **055** once at a warm idle says the
adaptations are settled (about −1.1 to −1.3), so a comparison holds
(`refuted.md` C19).

**Item 6 — the drives** (*decided 10/10/2026*; *the owner, 21/10: the
tank on the display, the captures after it*). The display follows the
idle through the tank; the captures read where it got to. The dips' shares need
several drives pooled, and they cost nothing. **Read**: `cutscan.py
--shares` on the idles, alone and pooled since the last repair — the
share the top two carry and p against all four alike (`open.md`, *The
dips keep to one slot*); `--name` too if a capture has cuts. 014 by stop
and `IdleHealth` by oil band against `open.md` S1 and S3. **003** says
whether anything sealed or opened; **020** is data, not a step: whether
cylinder 4's retard, nearly gone with the new leads on 10/10, stays gone
(S4).

**No captures until the display shows a change** (*owner's decision*,
23/10/2026), and **the hard run dropped** with them: it was planned because on
4/10 014 counted only at the stop after a hard drive, and that was an
adaptation completing rather than load (`refuted.md` C19).
What it costs: a capture on plain fuel just before the cleaner, the
reference its tanks would have been read against. What is left: `40`,
the refit drive of 21/10 on plain fuel, as that reference; the display
through the tanks; and the captures once `IdleHealth` moves, which then
say what moved.

**Item 6i — the oil level on the new oil** (`open.md` H18; `refuted.md` C21; *the
owner's agreement*, 26/10). Oil burnt past the stem seals or rings lowers
the level; fuel collecting in the oil raises it (*general*). On the old
oil neither could be read: no known starting level, and the top-ups
included the litre lost at the cover joint (3/10). A fresh fill to a
photographed level gives the start. **Read**: a level falling between
top-ups → oil burnt, H18 (or the rings) up; a level rising → fuel in the
oil, `refuted.md` C21 revived; steady → neither in quantity. **The engine
does not leak** (*owner*, 31/10, from right under it: the oil on the
sump is the old cover-joint leak's, and what drips is the gearbox;
`open.md`, *Other*), so a falling level is oil burnt. Five minutes standing and
level ground because the stick reads the sump only once the oil has run
back; the photograph because a millimetre is the stick's resolution.

**Item 7 — the exhaust ahead of the front probe (H2), warm.** A leak that
draws air in at idle blows out when the outlet is closed, and hisses or
puffs; a crack in cast iron may only open hot (*general*). **Cold found
nothing on 12/10** (`idle-log.md`), so warm is what is left. Each closure shows
as a dip in engine speed, which places it in time but not in space. The sound
says only engine bay or underbody; **the photographs locate** (a leak
leaves soot), though the manifold under its heat shield cannot be seen. **Read**: soot below → that
joint; louder from the engine bay with nothing below → the manifold or
its joint to the head, the owner's standing decision of a new manifold
(3/10/2026); nothing either way → a garage with a lift. Nothing leaks
ahead of the probe → H2 refuted for its zone, into `refuted.md`.

**Item 7 — the high-voltage side** (`open.md` H4, H15): the roughest
reading on record came on a foggy morning (`open.md` S1, *Temperature*),
and the mist supplies the moisture a tracking boot or coil needs. Late
because the coil is from 6/2026 and the leads are new again; it is free.

**Item 8 — the next repair** is chosen then, from `open.md`, *The idle's
candidates, ranked*. **Since 3/11 evening deposits (H13) and a valve on
3 (H1) lead** (*agreed with the owner*): `43`'s injector cut names
cylinder 3, the one the borescope found worst. The two 44K tanks moved
nothing, so a chemical clean through the fuel is spent; a professional
decarbonisation is **the next repair** (*the owner's decision*, 3/11), for
H13 and, if the deposit on 3's seat is what keeps it from sealing, H1.
**Read**: `IdleHealth` in the everyday state before and after, the same
ruler as item 6; a capture only once the display shows a change (item
6). What it reaches is asked first because a clean through the intake
works on the chambers and crowns, where the borescope found the
deposit, not on a seat that is worn (*general*). **The car had one
before**, with hydrogen, on 10/8/2021 (`vehicle-history.md`): its
effect was not recorded, and the 3,400 km and more since (152,000 at
1/2022 against 155,357 on 3/11, the odometer table there), most of
them gentle until 9/2026 and a year laid up, were enough to build what
the borescope saw in 10/2026 — so a clean is a reset, not a cure, if
gentle use comes back (*reasoned*). **2,000 rpm held, not idle**: an
hour at a standing idle would be the converter's exposure the standing
items avoid (122 of 129 counted misfire events began at a standing
idle, `open.md` S3); held revs are not. **Nothing measured there**, so
the before and after is `IdleHealth` on the display — **before** is
what is already read: 80–105 on the display on the remap (28/10–2/11),
and on the original map `42`'s 54–77 and `43`'s 48–86 loads off, plus
whatever item 6's drives give until the appointment — and H1's own test
(a warm compression or leak-down reading on 3 against the others,
`refuted.md` A4) stays for afterwards, if the clean does not help. **No injector swap**
and **no plug change for now** (*his decisions*, 3/11).

## Standing items — why

- **Every drive, for the converter** (all from this car's data): **122 of
  129 counted misfire events began at a standing idle** (`open.md` S3),
  so the converter's exposure is standing idle, cold warm-ups included.
  **Loads smooth it** (`open.md` S1, *Load smooths it*), and a dip is
  likelier when the charge falls (S1, *What comes before a dip*), so an
  electrical load or a little throttle at idle helps. **After a hard
  drive** 014 counted at every stop where gentle warm-ups had not
  (`open.md` S3, 4/10). **A flashing lamp** is the ECU's own
  converter-damage rate (SSP 175, `vcds.md`); this car's idle counts sit
  below even the 2 % that stores a code, so a flash means something new.
- **`IdleHealth` in the everyday state only** (*owner's decision*,
  28/10/2026). *Until 28/10 a warm stop was read in two states, 2 minutes
  every load off and 2 minutes every load on (owner's decision, 19/10),
  and the everyday state only when there was no time.* Every load on read
  calm every time and 014 counted nothing in it, so the pair stopped
  telling anything new, and four minutes standing worked against keeping
  the idling short. The everyday state (*owner's decision*, 23/10) — one
  fixed mild load, chosen because four minutes and main beam at every stop
  did not fit his driving — is now the one ruler, compared with itself. It
  sits between the two old states, calmer than every load off and rougher
  than every load on. **The closing of S1 and S3 is not read on it**: the
  marks stay in loads off (`open.md`, *When S1 closes*), read when the owner
  closes them, probably with the overrun too (*owner*, 28/10).
- **The fault memory** (*owner*, 18/10/2026): every session starts from
  an empty memory, and the saved file keeps what the session stored.
  Only when VCDS is connected anyway (*owner*, 24/10/2026): a plain
  drive is not worth a laptop, and a lit or flashing lamp is the
  backstop for what it would have caught.
- **The cover's nuts**: the gasket settles (`refuted.md` D5).
